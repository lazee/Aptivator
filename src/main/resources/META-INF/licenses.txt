Flying Saucer relies on several other free or open source projects in
order to build and run. Where binary Java JAR files are included, we include
only the unmodified binary releases as provided by those other projects.

Special thanks to Andy Streich, et. al. for Xilize
Xilize Text to HTML library
http://xilize.sourceforge.net/
License: GPL
Used version 3.x, only to produce documentation
Shipped with our source bundle as a convenience for developers rebuilding
documentation; we do not use nor link to the Xilize libraries at runtime

BeanShell

License: LGPL (dual-license with SPL)
Use version 2.x as Xilize has a dependency on it; used only to produce
documentation.

XML-APIs (extracted from Apache Xerces-2)
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/
License: Apache v2
We include the xml-apis.jar from the Xerces binary distribution in order to allow
our code to compile on JDK 1.4, which does not include newer XML APIs, even though
these API implementations will run on version 1.4 of the JRE. The JAR is unmodified
from the Xerces release, but is renamed as xml-apis-xerces-2.9.1.jar to
make the version clear.
Included as lib/xml-apis-xerces-2.9.1.jar
